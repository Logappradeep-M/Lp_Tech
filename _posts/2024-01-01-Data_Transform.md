## Data Transforms
The purpose of a data transform is to manipulate data in an application. Data transforms copy or manipulate data into the form you require. Data transforms can be used to convert data from one type to another, iterate over page lists, or page groups and copy entire pages at a time. 

Consider the checkout process of a purchasing application. The customer provides a shipping address and is prompted to provide a billing address. The billing address and shipping address are likely the same. It is more efficient to use a data transform to copy the shipping address to the billing address rather than have the customer reenter the shipping address.
