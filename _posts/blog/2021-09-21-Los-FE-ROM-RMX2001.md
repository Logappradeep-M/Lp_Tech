**LineageOS Android Distribution**
A free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform.
LineageOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 10, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.

LineageOS is based on the Android Open Source Project with extra contributions from many people within the Android community. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. Linked below is a package that has come from another Android project that restore the Google parts. LineageOS does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway.

Fan Edition:
Lineage Fan Edition v11.69 Isobar
This is a personal project based on Lineage OS with some tiny features and UI tweaks to make it cute :)
